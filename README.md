# Google-Places

Perform Queries based on a combination of places in Table 1 here:
https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/supported_types#table1

Replace whatever type of place in the code as "Target Type"

Currently the query is based off of Chicago lat&long coordinates but you can change it as you need
Note that the radius is in meteres and the max radius you can use is 50,000 per query

In the response answer you can find the address under "Vicinity"
"user_ratings_total" may also help you as a sign of populatiry / sales
It was tough to find the zipcode in the print out but worst case if you also scrape the lat & long I can show you how to get the full address using google maps api
